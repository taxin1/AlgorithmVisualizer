# Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview
Algorithm Visualizer is a JavaFX application designed to visualize various algorithms to aid in understanding their inner workings. This project provides a visual representation of algorithms such as sorting, searching, graph traversal, and more. With interactive animations and step-by-step execution, users can observe how algorithms operate in real-time.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualize algorithms with interactive animations to understand their behavior better.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Execute algorithms step-by-step to see how they progress through each iteration.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Implementations of various algorithms including sorting (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort), searching (e.g., linear search, binary search), and graph algorithms (e.g., depth-first search, breadth-first search).
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust parameters such as array size, animation speed, and input data to tailor the visualization experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI design for seamless interaction and easy navigation.
